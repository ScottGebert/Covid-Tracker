# CovidTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.5.


This is a province based Covid-19 tracking app that allows users to view case data for each location. The site has basic filtering in the future. I hope to improve it to include dates. The site has a main dashboard for viewing each province's key metrics. Every province also has its own statistics page where more metrics can be viewed as well as the numbers broken up by health zone.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
